PMI Electro Mobility Solutions Private Limited is India's largest electric bus manufacturer. It was incorporated in 2017 and is located in South Delhi
PMI Electro sells three types of buses: 12 meter, 9 meter, and 7 meter. The ranges are 180 km, 150 km, and 80 km, respectively. 
The buses are recharged with a quick charger twice a day for one hour. Their maximum speed is 80 km/h (50 mph). 
PMI Electro's annual manufacturing capacity is 1,500 units. This can be increased to 2,500 to 3,000 units on multiple shifts at its plant in Dharuhera, Haryana. 


# PMI Electro Transportation Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the PMI Electro Transportation Data Analysis project repository. This repository contains extensive data, code, and insights derived from a comprehensive analysis of transportation data from PMI Electro's depots in UP East. The dataset encompasses information on various aspects, including bus energy consumption, bus curtailment, driver availability, distance covered, curtailment reasons, and adherence to reporting standards.

## Data Cleaning
- **Data Sources**: Our data comes from various sources, including GPS trackers, maintenance logs, and driver reports. It is available in structured formats such as CSV and JSON.
- **Data Cleaning Process**: Our rigorous data cleaning process involved handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency. We utilized Python and pandas for this task, and the code for data cleaning is available in the `data_cleaning` directory.

## Data Analysis
- **Database Setup**: To facilitate robust data analysis, we established a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench. The schema structure is detailed in the `database_setup.sql` script.
- **SQL Queries**: The database enables efficient querying of data. Sample SQL queries for retrieving specific information are available in the `sql_queries` directory.
- **Data Visualization**: Data visualization was conducted using Power BI. We created a variety of insightful visualizations to aid in the understanding of the data. Screenshots of these visualizations are included in the `data_visualization` directory.

## Insights
Our analysis has revealed several key insights:

- **Energy Consumption**: We identified peak hours and patterns in energy consumption. This can aid in optimizing energy use and reducing operational costs.
- **Curtailment Analysis**: Curtailment data was analyzed in-depth, and various reasons behind curtailment were identified, such as maintenance, breakdowns, or scheduling issues. We offer potential solutions to reduce curtailment.
- **Driver Availability**: Insights into driver availability trends, considering factors like schedules, work hours, and driver satisfaction, were revealed.
- **Distance Analysis**: We analyzed distances covered by buses and identified correlations with variables like fuel consumption, weather conditions, and maintenance.
- **Reports Adherence**: The analysis delves into adherence to reporting standards and identifies areas for improvement.

## Route Efficiency and Revenue Insights
We conducted a detailed route analysis to determine route efficiency and its impact on revenue:

- **Route Analysis**: We evaluated the efficiency of different routes in terms of fuel consumption, travel time, and customer satisfaction.
- **Revenue Generation**: Our analysis identified the routes most efficient in generating revenue and explored the factors contributing to their success.
- **Customer Demand**: We analyzed customer demand on specific routes and examined its relationship with revenue.
- **Punctuality**: The punctuality of buses on different routes and its impact on customer retention and revenue was assessed.
- **Pricing Strategies**: We investigated whether pricing strategies influenced route revenue and customer preferences.
- **Competitive Analysis**: To provide context, we compared the performance of PMI Electro's routes with competitors in the region.

## Business Challenges and Questions
To drive further improvements and growth, we've raised the following key questions:

- **Operational Efficiency**: How can the transport firm improve operational efficiency in terms of on-time departures and arrivals?
- **Fuel Efficiency**: What strategies can be implemented to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce operating costs?
- **Driver Satisfaction**: What steps can be taken to improve driver satisfaction and retention rates?
- **Curtailment Reduction**: How can the firm reduce bus curtailment and its associated costs?
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Are there optimal maintenance scheduling strategies to minimize downtime?
- **Customer Experience**: What measures can be taken to enhance the overall customer experience, including punctuality and comfort?

## Business-Related Challenges
The electric vehicle (EV) transportation industry faces several business-related challenges, including:

1. **Charging Infrastructure**: Developing and maintaining a robust charging infrastructure, especially in areas with high demand.
2. **Battery Range**: Addressing range anxiety and optimizing routes and schedules for electric vehicles.
3. **Fleet Management**: Managing a fleet of electric vehicles efficiently, including charging schedules, maintenance, and route optimization.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating complex regulations, incentives, and emissions standards.
5. **Costs**: Managing the high initial investment of electric vehicles and planning for long-term sustainability.
6. **Maintenance and Repairs**: Handling unique maintenance requirements of electric vehicles.
7. **Driver Training**: Providing training for drivers to operate electric vehicles safely and efficiently.
8. **Market Demand**: Understanding and predicting market demand for EV transportation services.
9. **Sustainability**: Promoting environmental benefits while ensuring eco-friendly operations.
10. **Competition**: Standing out in an increasingly competitive electric transportation market.

These challenges are critical for the growth and sustainability of an EV transportation company.
